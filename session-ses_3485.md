Good points. Let me respond to each:

**1. Fallback** — depends on approach. `mini.ai` can chain specs: try treesitter first, fall back to pattern-based. `nvim-treesitter-textobjects` just silently does nothing if the query doesn't exist. So the framework choice matters here. Worth noting as a requirement: "degrade gracefully when treesitter queries aren't available."

**4. `b` vs `o`** — `b` is built-in for `()` parentheses (`ib` = inside parens). So `o` for blocks makes sense. Using `o` for both ruby blocks and markdown code fences is conceptually clean — they're both "blocks." For the backtick question: built-in `` i` ``/`` a` `` already selects text between backticks (which IS inline code in markdown). With treesitter, the nodes are different (`code_span` vs `fenced_code_block`), so `o` could target the fenced block specifically while `` ` `` handles inline code naturally. No clash.

**5. `A` for all arguments** — clean. Mirrors `w`/`W`. `ia` = inner single argument, `aA` = around all arguments including parens.

**6. Comments** — `gc` is an operator, not a textobject. There's no built-in "select this comment block" textobject. Treesitter has `@comment.outer` which could power one. For indentation-based: "select all contiguous lines at this indent level" is useful in YAML, Python, and generally for "this indented block." Common keys are `ii`/`ai`.

So the updated textobject list would be:

- `aF`/`iF` — function definition (`aM`/`iM` alias)
- `af`/`if` — function call (`am`/`im` alias)
- `ac`/`ic` — class/module
- `ao`/`io` — block (ruby do..end/`{}`, markdown code fences)
- `ia`/`aa` — single argument
- `iA`/`aA` — all arguments (including parens for `aA`)
- `B` — whole buffer
- `q` — any quotes (ties into surround)
- `ih` — git hunk (from git signs)
- Maybe: comment block (treesitter `@comment.outer`)
- Maybe: indentation level (`ii`/`ai`)

Does that look right? Anything to add/cut before I write it up?

## User

what happens when I have ruby blocks inside a markdown code block? 🤡
that's a question for later.
for markdown, let's do `o` for blocks.
can we also make ` do fenced_code_block AND code_span? or is it either/or?
it would select the closes (1st surrounding) one right?
or if not inside one or the other: the next one on the current line?
we always have `o` if we know we want fenced code block.
but ` is a "least surprise" type thing.

lets add the indentation one too.
what happens in this situation?

```ruby
def foo
  f = "f"
  o = "o"
  
  f + o + o
end
```

would it select the f, o, and f + o + o lines? since they're all at the indentation level? including the white line? that's most logical I think.

comment block.. there's gcgc which uncomments this commented thing.
but I think its single line usually.
i don't think @comment.outer works particularly well in ruby
what would the letter even be? K for Komment?

**Backtick for both** — yes, this should work with treesitter. It would target the nearest enclosing one (code_span or fenced_code_block), and if not inside either, the next one. `mini.ai` supports this "covering or next" search. So `` ` `` is "whatever backtick thing I'm in or near" and `o` is "I specifically want the fenced code block." Clean.

**Indentation** — yes, in your example with cursor on `f = "f"`:
- `ii` would select `f = "f"`, `o = "o"`, the blank line, and `f + o + o` (all lines at same indent, including blank lines in between)
- `ai` would typically also grab the surrounding container lines (`def foo` and `end`)

Blank line inclusion varies by implementation — we'd want it included as you said.

**Comment block** — honestly `@comment.outer` in Ruby just gets one `#` line since each is a separate node. For contiguous comment blocks you'd need pattern matching ("all adjacent lines starting with `#`"). And the key: `c` is class, `C` in normal mode is "change to end of line" but `iC`/`aC` in textobject context is fine... except it's visually close to `ic` (class). `/` or `#` could work but aren't language-agnostic. Probably not worth the bikeshed right now.

Let me write up the requirements and leave comment block as a maybe.

Right — `gqB` already formats the whole buffer via LSP. The `B` textobject would make this work naturally: `gq` is the format operator, `B` is the "whole buffer" textobject, so `gqB` = "format whole buffer" would just work™ without needing that special mapping. The special mapping could go away.

---

## User

no the special mapping can not be removed. some formatters don't support line based formatting and need an entire file. the B here is like -> OK the "whole buffer" textobject thing basically means "this file"

---

## Assistant (Shape · eu.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1 · 9.1s)



Ah right — `gq` normally works line-by-line with the LSP range formatting, but some formatters need the whole file passed at once. The `gqB` mapping isn't `gq` operator + `B` motion — it's a dedicated "format entire file" command that happens to use a memorable keybind. The `B` textobject is separate: it just means "select everything in this buffer" for use with any operator (`d`, `y`, `c`, etc.).

**#8 — Swap / reorder:**

Swap arguments left/right, swap method definitions up/down. What keybinds did you have in mind? Some common patterns:
- `>a`/`<a` to swap argument right/left (overloads indent operators contextually — might be confusing)
- `]e`/`[e` style bracket motions to "exchange" things
- Something under the text operations grouping

And for method definitions — is that "move this entire function up/down past the next sibling function"? Or more like "swap with the one above/below"?

---

## User

for markdown: i'd even want a "max width" type setup usually.
neovim can't really do that. perhaps zen mode helps.
but a max width of like 80 columns really nice when editing markdown on a wide screen so I don't have to move my head side to side
a "soft wrap" max that is. neovim can wrap at 80 but that's hard wrapping.

(this just came to me so I thought I'd mention before I forget. Make note of it?)

---

its a text operation I suppose.
not sure what the binds should be.
but swapping things are "move" operations
assuming we're basing this in my current surround preference:
gsaiw'
we might do
gmf "go move function (forward)" and gmF "go move function (backward)
that slightly violates f = function use and F is function definition...
but it makes sense in the n/N type forward/backward sense.
and "moving function use" makes no sense.

is gm... taken?

the whole "text operations" thing is hard.
gs for surround means we can't use it for "split"

to be refined...

> is that "move this entire function up/down past the next sibling function"? Or more like "swap with the one above/below"?

what is the difference?

## Assistant (Shape · eu.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1 · 18.6s)

**Markdown max-width:** Noted. Neovim has no "soft wrap at column 80" — `wrap` wraps at window edge, `textwidth` hard-wraps. Zen mode solves this by creating a narrow centered window. I'll add it to the markdown requirements.

**`gm` is taken** — stock neovim: `gm` moves cursor to horizontal middle of the screen line. `gM` moves to middle of the text line. So `gm` prefix would shadow that.

**"Move past next sibling" vs "swap with one above/below"** — same thing, I was overcomplicating it. With functions A, B, C and cursor on B: "swap forward" → A, C, B. Same operation regardless of how you phrase it.

The text operations keybind scheme is clearly not settled yet. Let me just note what we know and the open questions.

**#9 — Surround** next, or do you want to keep noodling on the text operations keybind scheme first?

---

## User

arguments aren't always left/right arguments can be multiline.
btw, can it do both arguments as in when passing in
and arguments in the function definition?
left/right is next/prev semantically. depending on multiline or not.

are we just moving methods & args?
anything else we could want to move? probably not right? or am I overlooking something?

---

## Assistant (Shape · eu.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1 · 14.4s)



You're right — "left/right" is wrong, it's next/prev sibling in the AST. Whether they're laid out horizontally or vertically doesn't matter.

For arguments: yes, both call-site arguments and definition parameters are the same treesitter concept (`@parameter`). `def foo(a, b, c)` and `foo(x, y, z)` — swapping works in both contexts.

What else could you want to swap? Thinking through it:
- **Hash/object entries** — `{ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }` → swap `a: 1` with `b: 2`. Same structure as arguments really.
- **Array/list elements** — `[1, 2, 3]` → same deal.
- **Conditional branches** — swap if/elsif? Exotic. Probably not.
- **Import statements** — reorder `require` lines? That's more of a sort operation.

Arguments, parameters, hash entries, and array elements are all "comma-separated siblings" at the end of the day. A good swap implementation handles all of them since they share the same tree structure. Methods/functions are "block-level siblings" — different category.

So really it's two kinds of swap:
1. **Sibling elements** (args, params, hash entries, array items) — next/prev
2. **Sibling blocks** (function/method definitions) — next/prev

Both are "swap with adjacent sibling in the AST." The distinction is granularity, not mechanism.

Anything else? I don't think so. Those two cover it.

Want me to update #8 with this, then move to surround?

---

## User

yes but we don't have treesitter stuff for "array element" or "hash entry"
in argument lists it sort of makes sense (although it is semantically more difficult. e.g. ruby has positional and keyword args so we have to get smart to get it right all the time. might be fine to ignore the details and just have the "semi OK" one there.

really just "move method up/down" is the most used one probably.

**#9 — Surround:**

You mentioned `gsaiw'` as your current pattern — `gs` prefix, then `a` for add. So:
- `gsa{motion}{char}` — add surround
- `gsd{char}` — delete surround
- `gsr{old}{new}` — replace/change surround

And `q` should work as a target meaning "any quotes."

Anything else? Tags (`<div>`)? Function calls (`gsafprint` to wrap in `print()`)? HTML-specific stuff? How often do you actually use those if so?

---

## User

i don't really use those often, i just know that my current editor has them setup

back to textobjects, i think it has a t for "tag" textobject too. in/arround.

those are nice to have, not really must have.

Actually — `it`/`at` for tags is already built into vim (`:h at`). So that's free. Might want to note that.

**#10 — Split / join:**

You said you use this regularly. Current binds are `<leader>c{s,S,j,J}` ("code split"). What do you need from it?

- Toggle (single key to flip between forms) vs explicit split/join?
- Cursor position: stay where you are, or move to the start of the changed region?
- Any language-specific quirks? Ruby trailing commas, Lua table formatting, etc.?

---

## User

i'm pretty happy with the current plugin I use: treesj.
s splits the current node, S splits it and all children
j joins the current node if split, J does the same recursively to its children
not sure where the cursor goes or anything.
its already smart enough to convert ruby blocks from do; end; to { } and back.

might be open to looking at other possible implementations.

## Assistant (Shape · eu.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1 · 5.7s)



Pretty simple feature. Vertical lines showing indent levels. Any specific wants?

- Scope highlighting (highlight the guide for the current scope differently)?
- Animate/fade or just static lines?
- Should they show inside blank lines too (connect guides across empty lines)?
- Current indent level only, or all levels?

---

## User

all levels
current one highlighted, the rest very subtle
that's scope highlighted I suppose? or is that something different?
it should show inside blank lines yes.
no need to fade or animate.

## Assistant (Shape · eu.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1 · 6.2s)



Scope highlighting = exactly what you described. The guide for the scope you're currently in is visually distinct, the rest are barely visible. Same thing.

**#12 — Treesitter context:**

Show current scope at top of buffer. You said toggleable. Anything beyond "show the enclosing function/class/block name at the top when scrolled past it"? Max lines? Click to jump?

---

## User

i think you just removed 10 split/join? on accident?
"no animation" is not a requirement worth mentioning.

for context view: i think this will come in handy when in rspec. i have some huge rswag files (which is rspec for OpenAPI / swagger) where it is really dificult to see the nested context I'm in. in this case it could be worth it to have like 10 lines of context or something ridiculous like that.

it just needs to show it.
maybe the navigation to "jump to context" is nice. who knows.

since I also have the dropbar it probably won't be on all the time.
that's a bit duplicate.

**#13 — Incremental selection** next?

---

## User

sure

---

## Assistant (Shape · eu.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1 · 6.7s)



Expand/shrink selection by semantic scope. Press a key to go wider (expression → statement → block → function), press another to shrink back.

- What keys? Common choices: `<C-space>` to expand, `<C-backspace>` or `<BS>` to shrink. Or `v` to expand from normal mode then keep pressing `v`? Some plugins overload `v` in visual mode to mean "expand."
- Should it start from normal mode (entering visual) or only work once you're already in visual mode?

---

## User

random one: in visual mode if I > to indent -> it should `gv` so i don't lose selection. make a note of it?

---

i previously used CTRL-ENTER in normal mode, ENTER in visual mode, and backspace to shrink.
that's slightly unergonomic
i think backspace is normally also already just "1 less character" right?
so that's also overloading something?
<C-space> might be good. and <C-backspace> is probably fine.

## Assistant (Shape · eu.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1 · 9.2s)

Already done. No note needed.

On the keys: yes, `<BS>` in visual mode is "delete selection" (same as `x`). So you'd be overloading that. `<C-space>` to expand and `<C-backspace>` to shrink is clean — neither has a meaningful default mapping.

**#14 — Jbuilder = ruby filetype** is just `vim.filetype.add({ extension = { jbuilder = "ruby" } })`. Any requirements beyond that, or just ship it?

---

nope. just unsure where to put it. probably doesn't matter much. unsure why it isn't default.

---

## Assistant (Shape · eu.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1 · 7.2s)



Probably not default because jbuilder is a Rails-specific templating gem, not a widely-known format. For placement: `plugin/filetypes.lua` makes sense — standalone, no dependencies, no import order concerns. Exactly the kind of thing `plugin/` is for.

**#15 — Trailing whitespace.** You said requirements are fuzzy. Options are: auto-strip on save, manual command, highlight so you see it, or some combination. What's your gut feeling? Do you want to *see* trailing whitespace, or just have it gone?

---

## User

highlighting is already sort of done.. at least the listchars are there.
don't want it in my face.
i suppose let's just enable auto stripping on write.
if it gets annoying I can go to using a command.
is there a command I can run actually? for that? the "auto" part should just run the command that way I can also always just run the command on unsaved buffers.

---

## Assistant (Shape · eu.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1 · 9.2s)



There's no built-in command for it, but the implementation is trivial — a function that strips trailing whitespace, then an autocmd that calls it on BufWritePre. The function can also be exposed as a command (`:StripWhitespace` or whatever) so you can run it manually on unsaved buffers.

Something like: substitute `\s\+$` on every line, restore cursor position, don't pollute search history. One-liner basically.

it should always expose a command `StripTrailingWhitespace` -> then run that command before writing the buffer. that way i have it.
StripTrailingWhitespace is more accurate and fine since commands are auto completed

**#16 — Markdown:**

You mentioned: wrapping, in-buffer rendering, markdown-specific textobjects (fenced code blocks via `o`), and soft-wrap at ~80 columns on wide screens. Plus you work with a lot of markdown these days.

- For wrapping: soft-wrap at window edge with `linebreak`/`breakindent`, `j`/`k` remapped to `gj`/`gk`. The ~80 column thing needs a narrow window (zen mode) since nvim can't soft-wrap at a specific column.
- For rendering: headings, code fences, checkboxes, links rendered visually in-buffer.
- Anything else? Table formatting? Auto-continue lists (press enter after `- item` and get `- ` on the next line)?

---

## User

tables are nice too, to preview.
so is "auto conitnue lists"

i was playing with some of the indentation options earlier. those probably clash with a markdown viewwing plugin... but got it to nicely keep the indent of list items as they soft-wrapped.

to be honest im on the fence between full "rendering" (as far as possible inside nvim) and just nice highlighting..

tables are messy no matter what.

the rest... good highlighting can do a lot maybe? compared to "rendering" and hiding syntax.

also: for links. does gx open them in the browser?
etc?
is that built in?

textobject is covered by that feature right? no need to repeat here?
or was it not?
both o and ` for markdown code fences if possible. ` also for code_span's.

gj/gk i need to try that out. probably want it that way with soft wrapping. but need to test. so "maybe".

auto continue lists.. for comments in code it automatically does this. there's then a keybind you can hit in insert mode that stops the "continuation". what was that again? does that work here too for lists maybe?

---

i think i want a very lightweight renderer. not just highlighting.

On `gx` — yes, built-in since nvim 0.10. Opens the URL under cursor in the system browser.

On the comment continuation stopping — that's `<C-u>` in insert mode. It deletes from cursor to start of line indent, which effectively removes the auto-inserted comment leader. Whether that works for markdown list continuation depends on how the list continuation is implemented (formatoptions vs plugin).

For the textobjects — `o` and `` ` `` are defined in feature #7 already. I'll just reference that here, not repeat.

OK, clean now. **#17 — Copy file reference** next?

---

## User

sure

---

## Assistant (Shape · eu.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1 · 11.1s)



**#17 — Copy file reference**

You said `file:line` format, rspec-compatible. So `spec/models/user_spec.rb:42` — that format works both for rspec (`rspec spec/models/user_spec.rb:42`) and for humans reading it.

- Relative to project root (git root? cwd?)?
- What goes to clipboard — the system clipboard (`+` register)?
- Keybind or command? You mentioned this is important for agent-centric workflow — sounds like something you'd do often enough for a keybind.
- The "maybe" extras from earlier: visual mode line ranges (`file:10-25`), full path variant, git host URL. Still maybes?

---

## User

cwd is easiest? for me that matches git root usually.
that's what "relative" means i suppose. to cwd.

+ register is the clipboard.
that's fine

i currently have a single command :CopyRelativePath that does just that.
that's what I use.

but I think it makes sense to upgrade it a bit.
to "reference" where I am currently.
either full path
or with/without line number
maybe even a permalink for github/gitlab for the current commit & state etc.
or not a permalink but just a link to this file on main
many possibilities.
the line number format probably differs from place to place.

maybe something exists for this? because its too much to hand roll I think

concrete use cases:
for rspec tests: nice to just copy where I am right now
for agent chats: nice to get the file name, or with line number (and range for visual)
either relative or full path.

should probably map it to keys at this point.
or maybe there's a "menu" it can go into for :CopyReference that asks which variant.
although that gets old...

Good news — there are plugins for the git URL part. The local path stuff is trivial to hand-roll, but the git host permalinks are where a plugin earns its keep.

**Options:**
- **`refgo.nvim`** — simple. `:RefCopy` gives you `file:line`. `:RefGo <ref>` jumps to a reference. Lightweight.
- **`gitlinker.nvim`** (linrongbin16 fork) — git host URLs. `GitLink` for `/blob` link, `GitLink blame` for blame link, `GitLink default_branch` for main branch link. Supports visual mode line ranges. GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.
- Combine both: refgo for local `file:line`, gitlinker for host URLs.
- Or hand-roll the simple cases (relative path ± line is 5 lines of lua), use gitlinker for URLs only.

For the "which variant" UX problem — a few approaches:
- Multiple keybinds under a prefix (`<leader>cr` relative, `<leader>cl` with line, `<leader>cg` git URL, etc.)
- A single keybind that does the most common thing (relative + line), commands for the rest
- `vim.ui.select` menu — you said that gets old though

307: - Auto-continue lists: press enter after `- item` and get `- ` on next line. Should be stoppable (like `<C-u>` stops comment continuation — investigate if this works for lists too, or if it depends on the implementation).

## User

maybe a command with arguments is cool
most common one can be mapped
the rest is doable via CopyReference line absolute
or smth.
not sure how that works in visual mode

---

## Assistant (Shape · eu.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1 · 10.5s)



Visual mode commands work fine — vim passes the visual range to the command automatically. You'd get the line range for free. So `:CopyReference line` in visual mode would know it's lines 10-25.

The syntax could be something like:
- `:CopyReference` — relative path + current line (the default)
- `:CopyReference path` — just the relative path, no line
- `:CopyReference absolute` — full path + line
- `:CopyReference url` — git host permalink

All work in visual mode to get ranges. Tab-completion on the arguments.

Right — if visual selection is a single line, just `file:42`, not `file:42-42`.

**#18 — Fast motions:**

2-char jump. Starting simple with leap-style. You mentioned wanting to explore remote actions and treesitter selection later (those are in #39 maybe/explore).

For the basics:
- `s` to leap (bidirectional? or `s` forward, `S` backward?)
- Does it work in operator-pending mode? (`ds{leap}` to delete to a leap target)
- `s` in normal mode shadows stock `s` (which is just `cl`). That OK?

---

## User

bidirectional. just "anywhere on the screen" any window, doesn't matter.
the idea is: i'm looking somewhere, and without paying attention to where the cursor is now i can just `s??` and be there.
operator pending mode - not really
the "remote" thing is operator pending though.
but "delete from here to 'anywhere on the screen'" isn't the use case. neither is expanding visual selection really
actually... flash does this for me already.. so maybe its nice to just have it in operator pending mode too. just so its "least surprise" always available.

- s in normal mode shadows stock s (which is just cl)
not sure what you mean?
oh... yeah i never use that so OK to overwrite

---

## Assistant (Shape · eu.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1 · 10.1s)



Clear. The core use case is "I see where I want to be, I press `s` + two chars, I'm there." Any window. Bidirectional. No thinking about where the cursor is now.

Operator-pending as a nice-to-have for least surprise — it's there if you reach for it.

**#19 — Motion repeat** (`;`/`,` for all bracket motions)?

---

## User

yeah

---

## Assistant (Shape · eu.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1 · 6.3s)



Pretty straightforward. `;` repeats last bracket motion forward, `,` repeats backward. Should cover all `]`/`[` motions: hunks, diagnostics, quickfix, etc.

- Should it also handle `f`/`t`/`F`/`T`? (That's stock behavior, but some plugins take over `;`/`,` and need to explicitly preserve it.)
- Should the leap/flash motion be repeatable with `;`/`,` too? Or is that weird since it's bidirectional?
- Anything else that should be repeatable?

---

## User

leap flash makes no sense to repeat?
f/t YES those should be repeatable.

---

## Assistant (Shape · eu.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1 · 8.6s)



Right — leap is "go to a specific spot," there's no direction to repeat. And `f`/`t` repeatability is stock vim behavior, but if a plugin takes over `;`/`,` it needs to preserve that. Good requirement.

**#20 — Diagnostics?**

---

## User

do we have motions for ]m ]f ]a textobjects planned?
i'm on the fence. i used to have them. didn't use them very much.
a good treewalker mode should probably help us out here and make this redundant.
also nvim already has ]] i think

---

## Assistant (Shape · eu.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1 · 20.0s)



Yeah, nvim has `]]`/`[[` (jump to next/prev `{` in column 1 — a very old C-centric motion). Some ftplugins override it to jump to functions/methods.

Treesitter-textobjects used to provide `]m`/`[m` (method), `]f`/`[f` (function), etc. But you're right — if treewalker mode gives you rapid AST navigation (jump to next sibling, parent, child), dedicated motions for each node type become redundant. Treewalker is "I want to move through the structure" which is the same use case.

Stock nvim also has `]m`/`[m` for jumping to method starts/ends in some filetypes.

I'd say: skip dedicated textobject motions for now. If treewalker mode doesn't pan out, revisit. Note it as a conscious skip?

---

## User

or as a maybe.
as with any ]/[ motion there would also be ]M for last method, [M for first, maybe that's useful?
and they'd be repeatable.
so if its easy to add, let's put them there for least surprise?

---

## Assistant (Shape · eu.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1 · 12.0s)



Fair point — if the textobjects exist (`aF`, `af`, `ac`, etc.) then having matching bracket motions for them is just consistency. And with motion repeat they'd get `;`/`,` for free.

Let me add it as a maybe on textobjects, since it depends on the implementation being straightforward.

So — no custom diagnostic config at all. You're on pure nvim defaults: virtual text at end of line, `]d`/`[d` to navigate, signs in the sign column with default icons.

What's there to improve? Some things people commonly tweak:
- Sign column icons (replace default text with cleaner icons)
- Virtual text: on or off? Only for current line? Only errors?
- Float on cursor hold (hover over a diagnostic, see the full message)
- `]d`/`[d` + `]D`/`[D` following your navigation conventions
- Severity filtering (jump to errors only vs all)
- Send all diagnostics to quickfix

What of that matters to you?

---

## User

all diagnostics to the quickfix is probably nice
does that do only the current buffer or the entire project?
maybe clean up the icons.
and virual text should probably be toggleable.
current line might be nice? maybe on "hold"?
theres CTRL-W d which I usually use.
i think in-line diagnostics are messy -> but maybe if i can toggle them

severity filtering: how would we even? like what's the UX?

---

## Assistant (Shape · eu.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1 · 22.0s)



`vim.diagnostic.setqflist()` can do current buffer or all buffers — you pass a scope parameter. So both are available as commands.

`<C-w>d` — that opens the diagnostic float for the current line. Good, that's already your muscle memory.

Severity filtering for navigation: `]d` could jump to any diagnostic, or you could have a variant that only jumps to errors. Common patterns:
- `]d` all diagnostics, `]e` errors only (but `e` is "end of word"... conflicts)
- `]d` all, `]D` errors only (instead of first/last — breaks your navigation convention though)
- Just use `]d` for all and don't bother filtering

Honestly, filtering during navigation is niche. If you mostly care about errors you can filter the quickfix list instead (that's what quickfix improvements #32 would give you). Simpler.
